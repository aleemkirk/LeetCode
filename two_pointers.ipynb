    "The Two Pointer algorithm utilizes two pointers that represent an index or a position within a data structure like an array or a liked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an array has **predictable dynamics** like being sorted we can use two pointers in a logical way to take advantage of it's predictability and lead to improved time and space complexity then traversing the data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main types of two pointer strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inward Traversal - pointers start at the opposite end of the data structure and move inward.\n",
    "2. Unidirectional Traversal - pointers start at the same end and move in the same direction.\n",
    "3. Staged Traversal - one pointer traverses the data structure and another keeps track of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two-pointer algorithm usually requires a linear data structure like an array or linked list and can be used when the problem can be solved using predictable dynamics or asks for a pair of values or a result that can be generated from a pair of values."
